# fetchables
A list of things that can be fetched by our other programs. This allows us to use i.e [khaos-utils](https://github.com/KhaosMC/khaos-utils) animal command, where we can easily fetch the list of animals supported without updating and restarting the bot!

## animal-list.json
This is used as a list for supported animals by the animal command in khaos-utils. If you have any suggestions, feel free to pull request or make an issue.
